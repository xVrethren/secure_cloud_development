An RDS instance allows users to interact with a relational database within the cloud. The RDS instance is the framework that a database would reside on.

RDS instances are placed within a VPC and behind security groups to boost security and network organization. VPCs allows resources to be shielded from public internet access along with all of the other features VPCs have. Integrating that with the traffic control of security groups, AWS has multiple layers of security.
